  <h1>Divine Private Court</h1>
  <h2>Ecclesiastical | Common Law | Constitutional Law | Natural & Universal Jurisdiction</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p>The <strong>Divine Private Court</strong> is the supreme authority for righteous judgment and spiritual remedy. It stands above all man-made jurisdictions and harmonizes all lawful systems of the Earth and beyond.</p>

    <p>This Court is governed and recognized by the following bodies of law:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Natural Law</strong> (law of the Creator and nature)</li>
      <li><strong>Common Law</strong> (law of the people, by the people)</li>
      <li><strong>Universal & Cosmic Law</strong> (spiritual and galactic covenant)</li>
      <li><strong>Ecclesiastical Law</strong> (biblical and divine law)</li>
      <li><strong>Constitutional Law</strong> ‚Äî Organic U.S. Constitution of 1776</li>
      <li><strong>Tartarian Mexum Constitution</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Recognized Treaties</strong> (internationally binding under Vienna Convention)</li>
      <li><strong>Public Statutes & Governance</strong> (recognized by United Nations & global registries)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This court is <strong>fully recognized worldwide</strong> and cooperates with sovereign bodies, nations, and agencies that respect Divine jurisdiction. It can override fraudulent courts, corporate actors, and government agents acting against your spiritual rights.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Jurisdiction and Authority</h3>
    <p>The Divine Private Court handles matters both seen and unseen ‚Äî spiritual, natural, carnal, and legal. From civil to commercial, ecclesiastical to interdimensional, this Court renders judgment swiftly and lawfully.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Family & estate disputes (especially under Trust Law)</li>
      <li>Government agency abuse (child support, unjust arrests, fraud)</li>
      <li>Private contracts, business disputes, and remedy claims</li>
      <li>Birthright, land, inheritance, and trust violations</li>
      <li>Sovereign declarations & nationality correction</li>
      <li>Full case remedy and judgment in 30 days or less (on average)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Citizenship, Status Correction, and Sovereign Standing</h3>
    <p>In addition to handling cases, the Divine Private Court also manages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Citizenship Enrollment</strong> ‚Äî Become a national or foreign citizen of your territory</li>
      <li><strong>Sovereign Status Correction</strong> ‚Äî Move from public subject to private man/woman</li>
      <li><strong>Trust Citizenship</strong> ‚Äî Operate through private trusts for full protection</li>
      <li><strong>Document Creation</strong> ‚Äî DS-11, 508(c)(1)(a), UCC filings, affidavits, declarations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once status is corrected, this Court can help you issue powerful remedy letters, demands, judgments, and enforceable documents that shift your standing in the world permanently.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>How to Submit a Case</h3>
