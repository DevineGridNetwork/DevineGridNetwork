    <h3>What Is a Trust?</h3>
    <p>A trust is a private contract and legal relationship that holds, protects, and manages property. You can place land, money, titles, vehicles, digital assets, businesses, and more into a trust. This protects your estate from legal attacks, government overreach, probate, and taxation.</p>
    <p>It is also a spiritual tool. Trust Law is rooted in Divine Law â€” where you, as the living man or woman, take dominion over your creation and pass it forward lawfully to the next generation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Three Main Roles in a Trust</h3>

      <li><strong>Trustee:</strong> The one who manages the trust</li>
      <li><strong>Beneficiary:</strong> The one who receives the benefit</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Trust Law Is the Highest Law</h3>
    <p>Governments, corporations, banks â€” even the Vatican â€” all operate under trust. The United States was founded as a trust. The elite protect their wealth using trusts. Now you can too.</p>
    <p>Trust Law stands above statutory and commercial code. When properly structured, your private trust becomes untouchable under Natural, Common, and Divine Law. You reclaim your legal dominion, protect your estate, and move in true sovereignty.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Benefits of Living Inside a Trust</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Protect your assets from lawsuits and public courts</li>
      <li>Avoid probate and government interference</li>
      <li>Create private generational wealth structures</li>
      <li>Pass down your legacy securely and lawfully</li>
      <li>Move your estate under a private jurisdiction</li>
      <li>Operate your business and ministry with true freedom</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even your clothes, your digital identity, and future creations can live inside your trust. You become your own system. A child born into a trust becomes a trust baby â€” protected from the world by divine contract.</p>
