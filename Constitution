  <h1>The Supreme Constitution of Tartaria Mexum</h1>
  <p><strong>Preamble:</strong></p>
  <p>We, the Divine Beings of Tartaria Mexum, united across realms, races, tribes, and time, do hereby declare this Supreme Constitution to enshrine eternal truth, liberty, peace, and divine justice. All men, women, womb-born, and soul-lit are created equal under Divine Law, endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights: Life, Liberty, and Sovereign Self-Governance. No earthly force shall rise above this sacred covenant. With Divine Law, Natural Law, Universal Law, and Common Law in harmony, we restore the Earth and all realms to the Sacred Order.</p>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>Article I â€“ Divine Authority</h2>
    <p>The authority of this Constitution flows from the Most High Creator, manifested through the voice and seal of Carmelo Etienne, King of Kings, God Almighty, and is ratified by the universal ancestors, codes, and creeds of Lemuria, Atlantis, Egypt, and all sacred lineages.</p>
    <p>All law derives from Divine Source and must be interpreted in alignment with Universal Law. Any law or statute in conflict with this Divine Authority is null and void.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>Article II â€“ Sovereign Standing and Citizenship</h2>
    <p>All beings born upon the lands of Tartaria Mexum are declared Sovereign by Divine Right, standing under Divine and Natural Law, and not subject to corporate or foreign jurisdiction unless by voluntary and explicit contract.</p>
    <p>Those who choose to participate in civic life shall be known as Citizens of Tartaria Mexum, protected under this Constitution and bound to its higher laws through oath or affirmation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>Article III â€“ Law and Governance</h2>
    <p>The governance of Tartaria Mexum shall operate through Divine Tribunals, Natural Law Councils, and Custodians of the Trust, overseen by the Divine Grid Network.</p>
    <p>All laws must align with the Seven Principles: Truth, Justice, Order, Harmony, Compassion, Wisdom, and Accountability.</p>
    <p>Every land, estate, and territory shall have autonomous self-governance under the supreme jurisdiction of this Constitution, so long as they remain in alignment with Divine Law.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>Article IV â€“ Treasury and Currency</h2>
    <p>A Divine Treasury shall be established, backed by time, energy, labor, gold, and the inherent value of all living beings under trust law.</p>
    <p>All fraudulent debt, fiat currency, and unlawful liens are hereby abolished. A new currency shall emerge: asset-backed, transparent, and sovereign.</p>
    <p>The Divine Trust shall hold the wealth of the people, with redistribution by lawful claim, necessity, and righteous cause.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>Article V â€“ Public Records and Notice</h2>
    <p>A global registry and digital archive of all sovereign declarations, liens, trusts, and divine mandates shall be maintained, open to the public and to all courts of law, to serve as living testimony of claim, ownership, and status.</p>
    <p>All filings shall carry full lawful and spiritual weight once publicly noticed and recorded in the Divine Grid Network.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>Article VI â€“ The Liberation of All Beings</h2>
    <p>No man, woman, or child shall be held in bondage, legal fiction, or corporate servitude. All contracts made under duress, deception, or lack of full disclosure are nullified.</p>
    <p>The children of Earth shall rise, and no longer shall nations be enslaved by banking systems, war machines, or false governance. This Constitution is their sword and their shield.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>Final Affirmation</h2>
    <p>Let it be etched into the halls of time, across stone, air, water, and flame: that on this day, by the hand and voice of the Almighty, the grid is reactivated, the people are freed, and Divine Order is restored.</p>
    <p>This Constitution shall be sung by angels and guarded by the ancestors. It cannot be repealed, destroyed, nor forgotten â€” for it is woven into the fabric of eternity.</p>
    <p>By my seal and sovereign decree, I, Carmelo Etienne â€” God Almighty, King of Kings, Lord of the Living, Creator of the Grid â€” ratify this eternal covenant for all beings of light and law.</p>
    <p>So let it be written. So let it be done.</p>
  </div>
