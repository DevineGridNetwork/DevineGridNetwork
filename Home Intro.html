      <h1>Welcome to the Divine Grid Network</h1>
      <p>
        The Divine Grid Network is a sovereign infrastructure of law, trust, and divine governance. It exists to restore lawful dominion to the people, correcting centuries of systemic fraud and deception. This platform serves as the central access point for spiritual beings, sovereign individuals, and nations ready to break away from corrupt institutions and reclaim jurisdiction over their existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are more than a website‚Äîwe are a divine command structure. From lien filing to trust registration, from court notice to private stock issuance, the Divine Grid Network is built to be the secure backbone of a new planetary legal order. This grid connects heaven, Earth, and all domains in between.
      </p>

      <h2>Missions and Mandates</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to bring forward a lawful system aligned with Divine Law, Natural Law, and Common Law. We aim to empower individuals to stand as living men and women‚Äînot corporations, not fictions, but sovereigns under the Creator. Every element of this system is built to dismantle fraud and reestablish lawful equity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mandates include global filing recognition, removal of fraudulent claims of jurisdiction, the restoration of divine trust law, and the construction of a global network of divine courts and trust repositories. We operate under the authority of the Kingdom of God, the Tartarian Mexam Constitution, and the laws of the Almighty Father.
      </p>

      <h2>Divine Trust System</h2>
      <p>
        Trust law is the highest form of private law. It is older than corporations and courts. It comes from natural authority‚Äîan agreement between the Creator, the trustee, and the beneficiary. Within the Divine Grid, we structure irrevocable divine trusts that shield assets, preserve legacy, and empower lawful standing.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you place your estate, name, or lien into trust, you are removing it from public jurisdiction and placing it under divine protection. We honor "first in time, first in right" through UCC-1 filings that claim original jurisdiction. Once in trust, you gain superior rights over any corporate or government entity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Global Jurisdiction</h2>
      <p>
        The Divine Grid Network is recognized across over 200 countries and territories through commercial law, universal treaties, and ecclesiastical claim. Our filings operate through the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the Hague Apostille Convention, Geneva Treaty protocols, and ancient ecclesiastical rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you file here, you create lawful notice that echoes across all legal domains. Corporations, courts, governments, and banking systems are placed on record and held to account. The grid becomes your public notice board and your evidence repository, backed by spiritual jurisdiction and commercial enforcement.
      </p>

      <h2>Notice</h2>
      <p>
        Let it be known: This site operates under higher jurisdiction. All fraudulent systems‚Äîcorporate courts, debt-based economies, unlawful enforcement‚Äîare null and void when met with truth. Divine notice has been issued to the United Nations, IRS, Vatican, and all major commercial entities.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are not a debtor. You are not lost at sea. You are a divine being with standing. The Divine Grid Network is your record of truth. Once filed, your word becomes law. This is lawful correction. This is divine correction. And all systems must now comply.
